# ColorBold
Prototype app to help colorblind individuals. Created during the USF Empowerment Hackathon '18 by Chaitanya Mattey alongside great teammates in Alexandra Wong and Sarah Lopez.

Do make sure you have all the relevant libraries installed.<br>
These include:<br>
1. OpenCV: Computer Vision Library
2. Tkinter: The python GUI package<br>
3. PIL: Python Image Library<br>
<br>

It is recommended that you use a virtual environment, and install the above packages in it.<br>
Then proceed to run the tkinter_gui.py from inside the virtual environment.<br>
Images around 500x500 work well with the current version.<br>
The color modification algorithm needs to be modified in order to handle higher resolution images.
<br>
Example:<br>
Original Image<br>
<img src = "https://github.com/cmattey/ColorBold/blob/master/example/original.png" height = "300" width = "350">
<br>
Modified Image to Highlight Red Hues in the image<br>
<img src = "https://github.com/cmattey/ColorBold/blob/master/example/showing_red.png" height = "300" width = "350">
